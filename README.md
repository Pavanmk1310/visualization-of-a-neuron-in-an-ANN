# visualization-of-a-neuron-in-an-ANN

this code magnifies the operations done on the weights and the bias of a single neuron 
it is visualized by the graphviz api more about that on :https://graphviz.org/
this neuron only works on 1D scalar quantities whaeras in neural networks tensors are used .

this same code can be implemented for tensors using pytorch and its functions like 
torch.tensor,torch.autograd etc
